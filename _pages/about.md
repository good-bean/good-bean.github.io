This site serves as a way for me to show what I have worked on, what I am currently working on, and what I want to work on. With that, I wanted to also show that I am multifaceted, as well as share my passions and skills.

## Professional

Although I started out in the Air Force as a backshop avionics technician, I am seeking a way into doing what I love for a living. My focus has always been to solve problems and to learn how to do so through code. Here's a list of my past roles:
- Web Developer
- Data Analyst
- Avionics Backshop Test Station and Components Craftsman
- Advanced Engineering Technician
- Microsoft 365 Business Support Agent
- Autodesk EDU Account and Product Support Agent

## Education

I have spent the past few years pursuing my Bachelor's of Science in Graphic Information Technology with a focus on Full Stack Web Development at Arizona State University. I changed my major from Software Engineering due to not being able to put my full attention to it. Long story short: My attention was fully on my academics and I was not able to put enough time into my family due to course load. I still have a passion for coding, regardless.

I have also taken a great interest in data analytics, with a focus on utilizing SQL, Python, Tableau, and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Personal

My first dive into coding was when I was 10 years old and my dad got me a VTech laptop that had a feature that taught me BASIC. I still remember my first "blast off" sequence! After that, I had a great interest in hacker culture, but I never really pursued that interest. Eventually, I found myself coding web sites as a teen, relying on Notepad and a browser. Despite taking a computer science course in high school (in Java), I didn't truly begin understanding Object-Oriented coding until my Software Engineering courses at ASU.

When I am not working, completing school work, or working on projects, I focus on my family. I am a mother to six children, most of which are off on their own adventures, two of which are at home with me. I am also wife to my husband Mason. I couldn't pursue my dreams without his support! I enjoy reading, listening to music, and learning new things. If you're a fellow bookworm, feel free to hit me up about my Goodreads. :)
